# Privacy Ferret 

**Privacy Ferret** is an **unofficial, Pale Moon–focused** fork of **Privacy Badger** by the **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**.

It aims to keep the classic XUL/Goanna ecosystem supported with a maintained, modernized tracker-blocking extension, while staying compatible with current Pale Moon releases.

## Features

- Blocks hidden third-party trackers as you browse
- Optional heuristic “learning” mode (can be toggled in Options)
- Per-site controls (domain sliders)
- Tracker counter badge on the toolbar icon
- Pale Moon–native packaging and UI

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.xpi` from **Releases** on this repository.
2. In Pale Moon: **Tools → Add-ons** → click the gear icon → **Install Add-on From File…**
3. Select the downloaded `.xpi`.

## Notes for Pale Moon users

- This project is designed specifically for **Pale Moon** (XUL-based).
- It is not an official EFF build and does not provide official EFF support links inside the UI.
