# Privacy Ferret

Privacy Ferret is a privacy-focused browser extension for **Pale Moon**.  
It is a fork of the original **Privacy Badger (XUL)** extension by the
**Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**, adapted and maintained specifically
for the Pale Moon platform.

Privacy Ferret automatically learns to block invisible trackers based on
their behavior, without relying on predefined filter lists.

## Project status

**Status:** BETA

Privacy Ferret is currently in active beta testing.
The extension is functional and stable on **Linux and Windows**, but further
cleanup and refinements are ongoing.

Some legacy components are intentionally retained for stability and
cross-platform compatibility. Additional cleanup will be performed
incrementally to avoid regressions, especially on Windows.

## Upstream relationship

Privacy Ferret is based on the original **XUL version of Privacy Badger**.

While Privacy Ferret is developed independently for Pale Moon,
the project follows ongoing development of the **WebExtension version of
Privacy Badger** maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Relevant ideas, heuristics, and security-related improvements from upstream
may be selectively adapted when technically feasible.

Feature parity with the WebExtension version is **not guaranteed**.
